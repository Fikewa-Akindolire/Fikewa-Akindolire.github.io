  bio: |
    I’m currently a sophomore studying Business Management at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    From running my braiding business Blessed Braids by Kiwa to exploring the future of AI and product management, I love bringing ideas to life. 

    I'm also a lover of culture, movement, and community-from ASA African dance and jazz to volunteering and connecting with others.

      description: I’ve been playing Lacrosse since High school and it's been an incredibly rewarding experience. The sport taught me discipline, teamwork, and resilience - both on and off the field.

      title: Hair Braiding Business
      description: I run a hair braiding business called Blessed Braids by Kiwa, where I specialize in creating clean, stylish, & protective braid styles. Braiding is not just a skill for me -  it's a creative outlet & a way to help others feel confident & empowered through their hair.

      title: My Passion for Dance
      description: I love dancing in all styles-from lively beats of ASA African dance, to modern & jazz with my dance company, to the rhythmic stops and claps of step dancing. Each style brings me joy!
