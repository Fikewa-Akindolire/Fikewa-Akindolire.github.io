subtitle: A Data-Driven Approach to Estimating Air Quality in Urban Enviornments
project_title: "Monitoring Urban Air Pollution from Satellite Data Using Machine Learning"

problem: |
  Urban air pollution is difficult to monitor due to limited ground-based sensors. While satellite data, such as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), provides broader coverage, it requires calibration to accurately reflect surface-level PM2.5 concentrations. This project addresses the need to combine satellite and ground-based data to create a reliable and user-friendly tool for monitoring air quality in the Baltimore-Washington area.

approach: |
  Students will align satellite and ground-based data, apply machine learning techniques, and validate their results to develop a model for estimating PM2.5 concentrations from satellite data.

    -Prepare two datasets: satellite-based AOD data and EPA ground-based PM2.5 measurements.

    -Match datasets by time stamps for accurate alignment.

    -Conduct a literature review on satellite data retrieval and machine learning methods.

    -Implement machine learning algorithms using Python.

    -Validate model accuracy and perform error analysis using Python tools.

    -Document research progress in a report or conference paper under faculty guidance.

outcome: |
  The outcome of this project is to equip students with practical experience in applying machine learning techniques to satellite data for monitoring air quality. By the end of the project, students will have developed a working model to estimate PM2.5 concentrations from AOD data and gained hands-on skills in data preparation, analysis, and validation. They will also build a strong foundation in Python programming, satellite data interpretation, and research writing. Success will be measured by the accuracy of their model, the quality of their written report or conference paper, and their ability to clearly explain their methods and findings during evaluations with faculty mentors.
