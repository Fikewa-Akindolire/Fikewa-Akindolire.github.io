what_i_learned: |
    Today’s SAIRI Connected session gave us a refreshing blend of team bonding and technical learning. We kicked things off in the School of Business with a lively game of Taboo, where we were split into teams and challenged to describe and guess words under pressure. It was both fun and energizing—and my team won the first round, which earned us an hour off from work (a reward I’ll definitely enjoy next week!).

    Later, we shifted gears and moved into a more academic setting where we were introduced to Overleaf, a collaborative LaTeX editor commonly used for writing research papers. We practiced transferring the content from our personal blog websites onto Overleaf, learning how to format and organize our writing in a more formal research setting.

    Back in the lab after lunch, we also had a discussion on the difference between a machine learning algorithm and a machine learning model. This helped clarify how algorithms are the procedures or formulas used to make predictions, while models are the trained outputs generated after running algorithms on data.

    Today was a bit hot, but in general I didn't have many blockers.  
  
reflection: |
   Today was one of the most enjoyable and well-balanced days of the program so far. Starting the morning with games helped build a stronger bond within our cohort, and it was a great reminder that learning doesn’t always have to be serious or structured. I appreciated how the energy from the game carried through the rest of the day.

    Lunch was another highlight—celebrating our graduate mentor’s birthday at a buffet gave us a chance to relax, laugh, and connect outside the lab. I even got to teach one of my teammates how to use chopsticks, which turned into a funny and wholesome moment.

    Overall, today felt like the perfect mix of productivity and play. I left feeling recharged, connected, and more confident in tools like Overleaf that we’ll be using for our final research papers.
