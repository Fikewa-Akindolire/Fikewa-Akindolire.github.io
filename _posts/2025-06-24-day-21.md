what_i_learned: |
    Today began with our cohort gathering in the School of Business, where we heard from Dr. Mack, our program coordinator. She walked us through what to expect for our upcoming Mid-Summer Presentation on Friday, answered our questions, and addressed some important program housekeeping items. It was helpful to get clear expectations and a chance to openly communicate.

    After a short break, we split into our labs. Because the Calloway building has been too hot, we’ve temporarily relocated to the Business building, which has become our new working space. There, we continued to refine our Padonia data frames, focusing on improving our R² score. We also created visual graphs showing PM 2.5 levels over time of day and seasons to help illustrate patterns in the data.

    Later, we began preparing for Friday’s presentation by dividing up slides and assigning sections for everyone to work on. This planning stage gave us a sense of direction and organization.

    After creating a graph using the Random Forest model and the Gradient Boosting model, I wasn't satisfied with the R2 score so I tried combining the two models. I had difficulty doing so, as it kept giving me a line of error. I'm still working on combating this issue and working to produce a result. 
  
reflection: |
    Today had a steady mix of structure, progress, and fun. Dr. Mack’s talk helped ground us in the importance of our upcoming presentation, and it felt good to have our questions heard and answered. Shifting our lab space has actually worked out well—it’s been more comfortable and allowed us to stay focused.

    What stood out the most, though, was the balance between hard work and lighthearted moments. Taking time to walk around the building and play a quick game of musical chairs gave everyone a much-needed energy boost and reminded me that productivity and joy can go hand-in-hand.

    As we head toward Friday’s big presentation, I feel both focused and supported by my team. We’ve got a lot to share—and a lot to be proud of.
