    Today I focused heavily on refining the Padonia data files based on corrections and suggestions provided by one of our graduate mentors. These adjustments were aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of our model. I spent most of the day implementing those changes and trying to boost the R² score, a critical metric for evaluating the model’s performance.

    In the afternoon, I experimented with ways to increase the feature importance of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in our model. The goal was to explore whether AOD alone could serve as a reliable predictor of PM2.5 levels. This task required a deeper understanding of how feature importance is calculated and how to interpret those values in relation to our target variable.

    We also reviewed our mid-summer presentation slides as a team with faculty members, incorporating feedback and making final adjustments.

    One of the main challenges today was improving the model’s R² score, even after applying the suggested corrections. Despite efforts to fine-tune the Padonia dataset and experiment with increasing the feature importance of AOD, the results were still not as strong as expected. Data quality issues and gaps in the dataset also made it difficult to draw consistent conclusions. Additionally, time constraints limited the ability to test alternative approaches. Finally, the unexpected thunderstorm and weather alert created some disruption, though we adapted by staying to continue our slide review as a team.
  
reflection: |
    Although most of today was spent troubleshooting and refining our models, I found it rewarding to see how small adjustments can impact performance metrics like R² and feature importance. It reminded me how sensitive machine learning models are to fine-tuning and how iterative the data science process really is.

    Taking a short brain break to play Uno together was a fun and refreshing reset, especially before we got hit with a heavy thunderstorm. Even though Dr. Mack gave us the option to leave early due to the weather alert, we stayed behind to go over our presentation. I think that shows how committed we are to delivering something we’re proud of. Despite the chaos outside, today felt productive and collaborative inside.
