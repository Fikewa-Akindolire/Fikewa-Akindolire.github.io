what_i_learned: |
  Today was a fun and educational day filled with tech and teamwork. We started with a presentation from Mr. Andrew on Computer Vision, 
where we learned how computers analyze and understand images and videos like humans. He explained key tasks like image classification, 
object detection, image tracking, and segmentation. We also got hands-on using YOLO V8 on Google Colab and explored OpenCV. Later, we worked 
in our project groups on an escape room challenge, which was a great team-building activity and helped me learn how my teammates solve problems.
We ended the day with Day 2 of the Python 101 workshop, where we learned about variables, input/output (I/O) cycle, type casting, and used tools 
like type() and input() while coding in Replit.

  During the Python 101 workshop, I ran into a few challenges while working in Replit. I had issues with formatting in my code, which caused some 
errors during execution. I was able to fix those by carefully reviewing my work and making corrections. I also encountered a problem with the original
file I was using—it was causing inaccuracies in my code, so I decided to create a new file, titled it Day 2, and transferred all of my work into it.
This helped me stay organized and continue practicing without confusion.
  
reflection: |
  Today’s experience helped me see how powerful and creative technology can be, especially through computer vision. Working with tools like YOLO V8 
and exploring concepts like object detection showed me how computers can see and make decisions. I also really enjoyed the escape room activity—it 
reminded me how important teamwork and communication are, even in tech spaces. The Python workshop helped solidify my understanding of basic
programming, especially the I/O cycle and how we interact with data. Overall, I learned a lot and feel more confident in both my coding skills 
and my ability to collaborate with others.
