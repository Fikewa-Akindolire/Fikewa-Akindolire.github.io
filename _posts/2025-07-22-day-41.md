what_i_learned: |
    Today was packed with a variety of technical and creative tasks that pushed both my data science skills and my communication abilities. I 
    started the morning by compiling and visualizing key model metrics—MSE, RMSE, R², and MAE—for all four of the machine learning models we’ve 
    built: LSTM, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). Seeing the metrics side-by-side helped me better understand 
    how each model performs and where improvements could be made.

    I also worked on generating a feature importance graph to see which variables are driving the predictions, especially for the tree-based 
    models. To complement that, I created a heatmap that helped visualize the correlations between features and PM2.5 concentrations. These 
    visual tools made our data story much more clear and intuitive.

    In the afternoon, I shifted gears to begin drafting our research paper, which allowed me to synthesize everything we've been doing this 
    summer into a cohesive narrative. I also joined my team to brainstorm ideas for our upcoming 90-second symposium pitch video, which needs 
    to creatively communicate the heart of our project by Thursday. We started scripting and planning our visuals so we can hook our audience
    right from the first few seconds.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    One of the best parts of today was seeing how all the pieces of our project—code, visuals, writing, and storytelling—are starting to come 
    together. Each task built on what I’ve been learning all summer, and it felt rewarding to move fluidly between technical work and creative
    problem-solving.

    The day wrapped on a surprisingly light-hearted note: we got the chance to learn and practice dances with our faculty mentors. It was 
    such a fun, energizing way to connect with them outside of our usual academic setting. It reminded me that even in the middle of intense
    research and deadlines, there’s room for joy and community.

    This experience continues to teach me that great research isn’t just about models and metrics—it’s also about people, storytelling, and 
    staying curious. I’m excited to keep pushing forward with the final stretch of our project.
