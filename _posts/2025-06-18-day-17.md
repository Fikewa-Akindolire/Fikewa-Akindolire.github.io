    Today was all about communication, collaboration, and building community. We started off with Dr. Mack addressing some important administrative updates, including absences and the change to our stipend. It was helpful to have things clarified and brought into the open for the whole cohort.

    We then shifted into a creative challenge—delivering a 30-second pitch about our research project while omitting key terms. This pushed us to think critically about how we communicate complex ideas in simple, engaging ways. Later, we played a survival scenario game, ranking 15 items based on their usefulness if stranded on a raft. It sparked a lot of laughter and debate, but also revealed how differently we all prioritize things.

    The highlight of the day was meeting the high school teachers who will be collaborating on our projects. After repeating our pitches for them, they tried to guess which group they’d be working with. It was a fun and engaging way to break the ice. Once paired, we took time to introduce ourselves and begin forming those early connections. Later, back in the lab, our graduate mentor gave an overview of our research to help orient the teachers.

    We also had an unexpected treat during a break—interacting with a youth robotics summer camp. We watched (and joined!) them playing mini games with robot machines they had programmed. My team even won a round of robot soccer, which added a playful, tech-filled highlight to our day.

    I slept a little late last night so I was a bit tired the following day, but I powered through it. It was also a bit warmer today so it was hard to concentrate at times. Also, I forgot to pack lunch, which was a bit of an upset, but it was okay because I brought a snack. 
  
reflection: |
    Today reminded me how important it is to be flexible, open, and ready to connect. Communicating our projects in a simplified way wasn’t easy—especially when we had to remove important keywords—but it taught me the value of clarity and adaptability in research communication. It also showed me how fun and engaging science can be when it’s broken down into digestible, real-world pieces.

    Meeting the high school teachers gave our project a fresh perspective, and it was exciting to start building that bridge between our university-level research and their classroom experiences. The robotics activity reminded me that behind all the data and analysis, STEM is ultimately about creativity, collaboration, and curiosity.

    It was a full day, but one that left me energized and excited for what’s ahead.
