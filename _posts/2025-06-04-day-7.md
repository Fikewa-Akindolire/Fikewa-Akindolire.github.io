    Today was a day full of learning, collaboration, and curiosity. I started my morning by diving into the basics of Python. As someone with little     to no prior experience, I know I have a lot to learn—but I’m excited to build my programming skills step by step. Python is a crucial tool in the     work we’re doing, and getting comfortable with it is a top priority for me.

    After our independent study time, we gathered with our graduate mentors for a group discussion to reflect on everything we learned yesterday. We reviewed literature on urban air pollution and talked in depth about the difference between PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5) and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). During the recap, I shared what stood out to me: the core of our project involves using machine learning to predict PM2.5 levels from satellite data. We’re essentially training a machine to understand and forecast air pollution using space-based observations—something I find incredibly innovative and relevant.

    After lunch, we got back to work, and my peers helped me further understand Python, especially the “why” behind how things work. Their support made a big difference and reminded me of the power of collaborative learning.

    Later in the day, we met with our faculty mentor, Dr. Li. We had a student-led discussion about our understanding of aerosols. This conversation led to a deeper discussion about the importance of curiosity in research. Dr. Li emphasized that being inquisitive and constantly asking questions is what drives great research—and great students. We also learned more about her personal journey into the field and what inspires her work.

    To wrap up the day, we were tasked with researching the true definition of aerosols using AI tools, along with any additional questions we had. This assignment not only helps deepen our understanding but also prepares us to explain what we’ve learned in our own words tomorrow.

    I'm still having trouble understanding python and the syntax used to code. Im learning new concepts everyday and I'm just working to stay on top of things and equip myself with the most knowledge.  
  
reflection: |
    Today’s experience reminded me that learning something new can feel overwhelming at first—but it’s also incredibly rewarding. Starting with           Python, I was a bit unsure of myself, but by the end of the day, I felt more confident thanks to the support of my peers and mentors. It was          encouraging to know that I don’t have to figure everything out alone—asking questions and leaning on others is part of the process.

    What stood out most to me was the realization that research isn’t just about having the answers; it’s about being curious enough to keep digging for them. Our discussions about aerosols and PM2.5 helped me see how science and technology—especially tools like machine learning—can be used to tackle real-world problems like air pollution. That gave me a sense of purpose and motivation.

    Hearing Dr. Li talk about her journey and why she loves her work made me think about my own path. It reminded me that passion and curiosity are powerful drivers in any career, especially in research. I’m excited to keep growing, asking more questions, and getting better at both the technical and critical thinking skills this project requires.
