    This morning, I started by experimenting with different lines of code to generate various graphs from the CSV file I had worked on the day before. It helped me visualize the data in new ways and deepened my understanding of how coding and data analysis come together in research.

    Afterward, we met with our graduate and faculty mentors to discuss the literature we reviewed previously. We reflected on our findings and talked through the structure of our upcoming research paper, which gave me clarity on how to organize scientific writing and communicate our data effectively.

    Next, we were assigned to review two more articles focused on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are used to predict PM 2.5 levels. These articles were especially fascinating because they directly related to the work we’re doing in our own project, which made the concepts feel more real and applicable.

    Later in the day, we took a short break to attend a campus food drive, where we were able to pick up both perishable and non-perishable food items. After the break, we went back to refining our literature reviews and writing up our paragraph summaries.

    To close out the day, we attended a presentation from our second graduate faculty mentor, who gave us a breakdown of data processing tools. He reviewed our past CSV cleaning work and made some edits live to show us how to improve. This session helped prepare us for the real data we’ll soon be handling.

    I had a bit of trouble running my lines of code because I wrote my codes out of order which affected the output of my graphs and the numerical value of my data. I wasn't able to solve it, but it's not the official files were going to be using so it wont affect anything. I'm learning from my experience, and now I know to be more organized.  
  
reflection: |
    Today was a full but fulfilling day. Starting with coding helped me feel more confident in my technical abilities, especially as I saw how different visualizations can bring data to life. The discussion with our mentors helped me realize how important it is to not only understand the science but also to be able to explain it clearly in writing.

    Reviewing AI and ML articles opened my eyes to the real-world impact of these technologies, especially in environmental research like ours. It was exciting to read material that mirrored what we’re building toward in our project. The food drive was a welcome and wholesome break that gave us a chance to connect with the community and regroup before diving back into our work.

    The day ended with more clarity and preparation, and I feel more equipped to handle real-world data moving forward. Overall, it was a productive mix of coding, learning, reading, and reflecting.
