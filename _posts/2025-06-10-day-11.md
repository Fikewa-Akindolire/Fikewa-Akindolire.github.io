    Today was a deep dive into both technical skills and scientific understanding—showing me just how interconnected coding and environmental research can be.
    
    We started by continuing work on the Padonia CSV files we imported yesterday. Our task was to clean the data and perform a series of operations in Google Colab using Python. With the collaboration of my team members, I was able to finish everything on time. This hands-on work helped me get more comfortable with code and showed me how important clean data is to meaningful analysis.

    Later in the day, we met with our graduate faculty mentor to discuss our research questions related to aerosol particles. Through this discussion, I learned that the aerosol lifecycle consists of four key stages: source, transformation, transport, and sink. It was really cool to dig into my findings and expand on them with my team.

    We wrapped up with a literature review of two articles. One explained how precipitation can act as both a sink and a source for particle formation, while the other detailed how aerosol particles disperse and deposit globally. Summarizing each article helped me better understand the science and practice communicating complex ideas clearly.

    At first I was having trouble figuring out the line of code to create a gragh on Google Colab, but with the help of my teamates the issue was resolved. I also struggled to focus while reading my articles for the literature review because I was among others, and it's harder for me to concentrate with distruptive external factors. 
  
reflection: |
    Today really highlighted the value of interdisciplinary learning. I went from cleaning raw datasets to studying atmospheric science—all in one day. It’s amazing to see how AI and machine learning can help us tackle major environmental issues like urban air pollution.

    The day ended with a unique, hands-on experience: my teammates, mentor, and I went to the roof of the building across from our lab to replace a part of the LIDAR system, which monitors particles in the atmosphere. It was the perfect way to connect our digital work with the physical tools that power real-world research.

    As someone who just started learning how to code, I’m proud of the progress I’m making—and excited to keep growing through this journey.
