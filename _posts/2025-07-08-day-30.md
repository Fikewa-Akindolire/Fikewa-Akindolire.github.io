    Today, I began the day focusing on some professional development by researching internships and co-op opportunities for the upcoming semester and next summer. I also took time to update my resume with my most recent work experience and submitted applications to a few programs and workshops that align with my career goals.

    To build on my technical knowledge, I continued watching educational videos about neural networks, gaining a deeper understanding of how they function and are trained to recognize patterns in data.

    Later in the day, we had a meeting with our graduate mentors at 3 PM to discuss our goals and deliverables for the week. A key focus will be interpolating our data and scaling our 1-hour PM2.5 data down to 30-minute intervals. We also plan to create consistent graphs that clearly demonstrate the spikes in PM2.5 levels, using uniform x and y axes for better comparison. These tasks will help enhance the clarity and accuracy of our data visualizations and support the larger objectives of our research project.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today was a balanced mix of personal growth and team planning. Taking time to search for internships and refine my resume helped me stay proactive about my future, and reminded me of how important it is to stay prepared and visible in a competitive field. I also appreciated the opportunity to apply to workshops and programs that could expose me to new ideas and networks.

    On the technical side, the neural network videos helped reinforce concepts I’d heard before, and I’m starting to see how those methods connect to real-world applications—like the kind of predictive modeling we’re doing in our air quality project. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into interpolation and visualization this week, especially since the clarity of our graphs will be essential in telling the story of PM2.5 spikes.
