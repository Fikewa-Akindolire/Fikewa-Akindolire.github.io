what_i_learned: |
    Today was all about storytelling through visuals. We kicked off the day finalizing the outline for our 90-second pitch video, which meant thinking
    critically about how to communicate our research in a way thatâ€™s engaging, clear, and visually compelling. From there, we hit multiple locations 
    around campus to film key scenes â€” from the construction site (to highlight real-world impact) to the Morgan State logo (for school pride), and 
    then to the School of Business, where we filmed ourselves collaborating and coding.

    We also began learning the basics of video editing using CapCut, getting hands-on experience piecing together clips, transitions, and organizing 
    our timeline. This taught me that communicating science is just as much about creativity and clarity as it is about technical knowledge.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today was definitely eventful â€” it felt like a blend of campus tour, creative shoot, and team bonding all in one. Filming around campus gave me 
    a deeper appreciation for how much effort goes into visually representing complex ideas in a short amount of time. Each location helped tell a
    different part of our story, and working together outside the usual coding environment added a fun and collaborative energy.

    Though we didnâ€™t get to finish everything today, Iâ€™m excited to jump into voiceovers and add captions and subtitles tomorrow. Itâ€™s rewarding to 
    see how far weâ€™ve come this summer â€” and now we get to share it with others in a way thatâ€™s exciting and easy to connect with.
