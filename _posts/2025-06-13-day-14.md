what_i_learned: |
    Today was centered around preparing our Week 3 slide presentations. Each of us worked on our respective sections, tailoring them to reflect our unique experiences and contributions. We also had a debrief on our literature review articles, where we shared insights and discussed key takeaways. This week’s readings felt more engaging because they directly connected to our project goals—it was exciting to finally envision how we could apply what we learned to build an AI model capable of predicting PM2.5 levels. Our graduate mentor reviewed our slides, providing helpful feedback and minor edits to enhance our work. Later in the day, we smoothly recorded our video presentation, building on the experience and lessons learned from the previous weeks.

reflection: |
    Today felt productive and collaborative from start to finish. Working on our slides gave me a moment to reflect on how much I’ve learned over the past few weeks. The literature review felt more meaningful this time because I could actually see the connection between the content and our project goals, which made everything click more clearly. A highlight of the day was an unexpected but thought-provoking conversation my team had during our break. It helped strengthen our bond beyond just work. Recording the video went much smoother than before, showing how far we’ve come as a team. All in all, today reminded me of the importance of teamwork, engagement, and clear communication.
