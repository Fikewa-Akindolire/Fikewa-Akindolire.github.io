what_i_learned: |
    Today began with a quick yet informative conversation from our graduate mentor about some of the issues we’ve been facing with the Padonia 30-minute data file. We learned that the missing data points are likely due to satellite limitations — specifically, that satellites can’t capture Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements at night. He shared the steps he’s currently taking to resolve the issue and reassured us that the corrections should be in place by next week.

    In the meantime, we switched gears to work with the Padonia 1-hour data file. I focused on cleaning the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and running it through a series of models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and GTW (Geographically and Temporally Weighted). After initial training, I fine-tuned the models using optimized parameters and analyzed the feature importance, which helped clarify which variables are contributing most to the predictions.

    I also continued progressing through the Product Roadmap Certification I started last week, deepening my understanding of product strategy and planning frameworks.

    I had numerous issues running my line of code for the Padonia 1hr file. I kept getting errors about my test and train data not being split correctly, certain libraries not being imported correctly, the displaying of labels on the x-axis being shown incorrectly for graphs, and other things as well. 
  
reflection: |
    Today was a great balance of technical problem-solving and team bonding. It was insightful to hear directly from our mentor about the real-world challenges of working with satellite data and the strategies used to address them. Shifting to the 1-hour file gave us an opportunity to stay productive while still preparing for next week’s improved dataset.

    On the machine learning side, working with multiple models and tuning parameters helped me grow more confident in evaluating model performance and interpreting feature importance — a critical skill in data science.

    The brain break at the end of the day, playing Wordle, Charades, and Simon Says, brought a lot of laughs and helped us bond as a cohort. It reminded me how important it is to take time to connect, especially when doing intense work. The blend of productivity and play made today both meaningful and enjoyable.
