    Today was packed with new knowledge and hands-on learning. We started the morning in the Business Building with a presentation by Dr. Chris
    Crawford on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). His talk opened up a new way of thinking about how humans and technology can work together in more 
    intuitive, even biological ways.

    Afterward, we split into two groups for interactive HCI workshops. The first activity used human electromagnetic brain waves to control a drone. 
    We wore special sunglasses equipped with sensors on the temple and a band across the forehead. Through a Scratch-like coding platform, we 
    programmed the drone to move based on physical signalsâ€”like teeth clenching to go forward and rapid eye movement to spin. It was fascinating to 
    see how brain wave types like Gamma, Beta, Theta, and Delta could be interpreted into real-time actions.

    The second activity involved using electromyography (EMG) sensorsâ€”three adhesive pads placed on our arms that picked up muscular signals. 
    Connected to a Ganglion board, we programmed the robot using a visual coding system to respond to hand gestures. For example, closing your hand 
    moved the robot forward or stopped it. It was a powerful example of how both internal (muscle) and external (brain wave) electrical activity can 
    control devices in real time.

    To wrap up, we regrouped in our research lab for a quick meeting with our graduate mentor to check in on our final deliverables. We also began
    dividing responsibilities for our final presentation, assigning slide sections and speakers. Since it was the last day weâ€™d see our faculty
    mentor before her trip to China, we took group photos to commemorate the moment.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today felt like a celebration of curiosity and community. The hands-on workshops reminded me why I love techâ€”itâ€™s not just about the code,
    but about creating real-world impact through innovation. It was surreal to see my own physical responses guide a robot or a drone. It made the 
    line between human and machine feel thinner than ever before.

    Beyond the tech, it was also a day full of appreciation. Saying goodbye to our faculty mentor reminded me how meaningful the relationships 
    weâ€™ve built are. From technical mentors to teammates, each person has played a part in shaping this experience. Our little dance break at the
    end was the perfect reminder that even in a program focused on data and algorithms, joy and culture have a place too.
