what_i_learned: |
    Today started with replying to our weekly debriefing video on Canvas, and it was really inspiring to see how much progress my cohort has made over time. After that, we met in the lecture hall for a session focused on using the Pandas library in Google Colab. We learned how to import CSV files and read multiple datasets at once. We explored how to identify and handle missing data by writing code to clean it, rename column titles for clarity, and even merge several datasets into one unified file. After lunch, we were given a new task: to import, clean, and merge data files on our own using the same tools. This hands-on experience really helped reinforce what we had just learned.

    I initially struggled with importing CSV files into Google Colab and understanding how to use the Pandas library. It took some time to grasp what each function does and how they should be properly formatted, but with practice and guidance, things gradually started to click.
  
reflection: |
    Truthfully, today felt like a breakthrough. Working with data, code, and new tools can feel overwhelming at times, especially since this is all so new to me. But as I followed the steps and completed the tasks, I felt reassured that I’m capable of learning and applying these skills. Today gave me a boost of confidence and reminded me that just because something is unfamiliar doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I’m proud of my progress so far and excited to keep learning. I’m also becoming more curious about all the different possibilities within data science and how I can apply these tools to real-world projects in the future.
