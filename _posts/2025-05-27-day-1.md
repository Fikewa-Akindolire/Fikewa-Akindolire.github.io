what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to use Git for version control, including key commands like add, commit, pull, and push. I now understand the importance of pulling before pushing to avoid conflicts, and the difference between Git and GitHub. We also took a quick placement test on programming languages and played a fun game of Jeopardy to review Git concepts. I really enjoyed the interactive learning style — it made everything clear, engaging, and easy to follow.

  I also started exploring how Python interfaces with the headset's BLE signals, preparing for real-time signal processing down the line.

reflection: |
  This session helped me build a solid foundation in using Git and understanding version control. I appreciated how the activities, like the placement test and Jeopardy game, made the learning process interactive and fun. The hands-on approach really helped the concepts click, and I feel more confident navigating Git and GitHub now.
