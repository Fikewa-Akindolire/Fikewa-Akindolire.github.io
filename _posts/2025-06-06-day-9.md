what_i_learned: |
    Today was all about tying everything together. We kicked off the morning by working on the slides for our video presentation later that evening.  It was exciting (and a little nerve-wracking) to look back on everything we had done throughout the week and figure out how to present it clearly     and confidently.
    
    Later in the morning, we headed outside to clean up the lidar system. This part was especially interesting because we actually got to see inside the system—a rare look at the technology we’ve been learning about all week. Getting hands-on with the hardware helped me connect the technical knowledge with the real-world tools being used.

    After lunch, we dove right back into finishing our presentation slides and began practicing. Eventually, we recorded our final presentation. It was a rewarding process to see the slideshow come together, and it clearly reflected all the work and knowledge we’ve gained throughout the week.

    While we were cleaning the Lidar system, it was incredibly difficult being outside in the sun with the flies constantly fluttering in our face. I can confidently say that was the low of the day. 
  
reflection: |
    This week flew by—but looking back, I’m honestly amazed at how much we were able to accomplish in just five days. Today really highlighted that. Seeing the final presentation made everything feel real. It’s one thing to go through daily tasks and learning moments, but when it all comes together into something you can present, it makes the growth feel tangible.

    I also realized how much I enjoy working in a team setting where everyone is focused and contributing. From cleaning up tech systems to finalizing slides and presenting as a group, every part of the process added to my understanding and confidence.

    It’s surprising how much you can do and learn in just a week when you’re fully engaged—and that makes me even more excited for what’s next.
