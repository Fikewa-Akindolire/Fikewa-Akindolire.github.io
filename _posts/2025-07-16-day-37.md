what_i_learned: |
    Today marked a major step forward in my research. I received the updated 30-minute AOD dataset—which, although it had some missing values—was 
    crucial to expanding the scope of our analysis. I began by merging this new file with our existing dataset that included PM2.5, windspeed,
    temperature, relative humidity, and more.

    Once merged, I ran several key analyses:

      - Predicted vs. Actual scatter plots
      - Feature importance analysis
      - Interpolation on missing values
      - AOD vs. PM2.5 scatter plots

    To my surprise (and relief), everything finally started aligning with my expectations. The model produced a higher R² score of 0.70,
    a meaningful improvement from previous runs. Even better, the feature importance chart made logical sense this time: AOD was ranked as the most 
    important predictor, followed by windspeed and temperature. This was a refreshing change from earlier models where date—an indirectly related 
    variable—would oddly rank first.

    Beyond coding, I also shifted gears for some professional development. I reconnected with several industry professionals I met during the fall
    semester by reaching out via LinkedIn—just checking in and nurturing those valuable relationships. I also began diving deeper into personal 
    finance: researching credit unions, learning about the stock market, and exploring the best ETFs and mutual funds to start investing in.

    Finally, I wrapped up the day by collaborating with my group on writing the introduction and abstract for our final report.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today felt like one of those “lightbulb” days. After so much back-and-forth with unexpected results, finally seeing outputs that matched 
    my intuition felt like discovering a small gold nugget in a long mining process. It reminded me how important it is to stay patient and trust
    the process, especially when working with real-world environmental data that can be messy and unpredictable.

    Seeing the model finally behave in a way that reflects real environmental relationships—like AOD being a strong predictor of PM2.5—gave me
    more confidence in the direction we’re heading. And taking the time to reconnect with professionals and explore personal finance helped me 
    feel more grounded in the bigger picture of my growth—not just as a student, but as a future leader.
