what_i_learned: |
    Today was a mix of focus, exploration, and collaboration. I began the day fine-tuning our slide presentation for the upcoming mid-summer presentation, making small but meaningful adjustments to improve clarity and flow. This helped sharpen my presentation design and storytelling skills.

    Midway through, I shifted gears and dove into the Product Roadmap Certification from Product School. While I initially thought I could make quick progress, I quickly realized how in-depth and rigorous the program is. It’s not just about surface-level learning—there’s a lot of strategic thinking, planning, and product vision involved, which is both exciting and a bit overwhelming.

    Later, I contributed to our weekly team presentation, specifically focusing on my slide that summarizes my progress for the week. We then recorded our video and got valuable feedback from our graduate mentor. To wrap up the day, we reviewed the mid-summer presentation deck with both our graduate and faculty mentors, ensuring we’re aligned and ready for next week.

    It was a bit chili in the building today, but other than that I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today was a reminder of the importance of balance and time management. While I was proud of the progress made on both our group presentation and my own slide, I found myself unexpectedly deep into the Product Roadmap certification. It’s clear now that this certification will require a more structured plan if I want to complete it meaningfully.

    Working with my team and mentors throughout the day reinforced how valuable collaborative review and feedback are. Every time we shared our work and listened to others’ input, the presentation improved. This iterative process feels a lot like building a product: you design, test, adjust, and improve. I’m walking away with a deeper appreciation for the connection between communication, planning, and execution—all critical to both product management and successful teamwork.
