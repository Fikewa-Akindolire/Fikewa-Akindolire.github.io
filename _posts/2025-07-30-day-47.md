what_i_learned: |
    Today was our last official workday, and it was all about preparation, refinement, and teamwork. We spent the morning fine-tuning our slide
    deck for tomorrowâ€™s presentation, ensuring every detail was clear and professional. Once we were satisfied, we practiced our run-throughsâ€”rehearsing
    each section and refining our delivery until we felt confident.

    We also prepared for our live demo, even inflating the balloons weâ€™ll use to bring our project to life. Moving to the lecture hall for an 
    official practice run with our faculty was a turning point. Their feedback not only sharpened our presentation but also eased my nerves. It was
    reassuring to get a real feel for the environment and receive their advice, which we immediately incorporated into our final edits.

    This experience reinforced the value of preparation, adaptability, and feedbackâ€”three skills that I know will carry over into future projects
    and presentations.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Ending the day with a celebratory lunch at Valentinoâ€™s buffet for Gracelynâ€™s birthday felt bittersweet. It was the perfect way to close this 
    chapterâ€”sharing laughs, stories, and accomplishments with the team that has made this journey so rewarding. While Iâ€™m a little sad this 
    experience is coming to an end, I feel incredibly grateful for the skills Iâ€™ve gained, the confidence Iâ€™ve built, and the connections Iâ€™ve 
    made along the way.

    As we head into tomorrowâ€™s presentation, Iâ€™m excited to showcase not just our research but also the collaboration and dedication behind
    it.
