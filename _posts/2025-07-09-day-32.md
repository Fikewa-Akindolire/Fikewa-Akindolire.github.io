what_i_learned: |
    Today was packed with hands-on learning and technical growth. Following up on our group meeting with Dr. Li, I began tackling our new task list, which focuses on deepening our research using AI and environmental data. Our goals include enhancing math education projects using AI and atmospheric pollution data, plotting time-series data for PM2.5 and AOD, exploring two additional AI algorithms, and researching data interpolation methods.

    I made progress on generating visualizations—starting with time vs. PM2.5 and AOD plots across two monitoring stations. I also reviewed techniques to interpolate hourly data into 30-minute intervals, an important step for improving the temporal resolution of our analysis. On top of that, I took time to study more about neural networks to strengthen my foundation for applying additional AI models effectively.

    It was really hot today. 
  
reflection: |
    Today reminded me how interdisciplinary and rewarding this work is. There’s a real sense of purpose in taking satellite data and making it meaningful—both for public health and for educational applications. Even though the workload ahead is challenging, I'm energized by the opportunity to connect data science, environmental justice, and education.

    Stepping away mid-day to visit the MSU Food Resource Center offered a refreshing break and some nutritious fuel—fresh fruits, vegetables, and non-perishables. I ended the day investing in myself, continuing my search for internships, mentorships, and workshops that align with my growth as a future product manager and researcher. Days like this show me that growth isn’t just about checking off tasks—it’s about being present, purposeful, and persistent.
