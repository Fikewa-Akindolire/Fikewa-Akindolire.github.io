    Today was all about preparation and polishing. We began by refining our slide presentation for tomorrow’s mid-summer showcase. With feedback from our graduate mentors, we made small but meaningful edits — improving the clarity of our graphs and tightening the wording throughout the deck.

    After those adjustments, we practiced our full presentation as a team. We ran through it twice before lunch to get comfortable with our pacing and transitions. One of our teammates also took the lead in finalizing the demo video we plan to show during the presentation.

    Before our final rehearsal, we took a short brain break and walked around the Calloway building. It was a nice way to refresh before the next round of focus. We also took a quick walk to the Jenkins building with our high school teacher, Ms. Ross-Jones, hoping to pick up some free produce and non-perishables — but learned the giveaway is actually next week.

    Finally, we ran through the full presentation in the lecture hall with all of our faculty and graduate mentors. Their feedback on delivery, timing, and clarity helped us sharpen the overall presentation. We even stayed back afterward to run through it one last time as a group.

    Today I spent the day rehersing my pitch for our Midsummer presentation, which was nerve racking because I was trying to remember as much as possible and also practice being comfortable with what I was saying. I also spent time fine-tuning & upadting the pitch so it was kind of hard trying to keep up with all the modifications. 
  
reflection: |
    Today felt like the calm before the storm — a day full of fine-tuning and teamwork. Practicing multiple times helped us grow more confident in our parts, and the feedback we received was a reminder of how much small changes can elevate a presentation.

    Our little “exploration break” around Calloway and the walk to Jenkins added a sense of fun to a day that could’ve easily felt intense. It reminded me that breaks are important — they helped us come back with clearer heads and stronger focus.

    Heading into tomorrow’s presentation, I feel proud of the work we’ve done and excited to finally share it. We’ve prepared thoroughly, supported one another, and improved with each run-through. Now it’s time to show everyone what we’ve been working on.
