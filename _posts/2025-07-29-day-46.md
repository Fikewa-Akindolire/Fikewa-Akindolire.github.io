what_i_learned: |
    Today was all about refining and preparing for success. I started the day by practicing my pitch for the final presentation, which helped me
    become more confident in my delivery and better at communicating complex ideas clearly. We also focused on fine-tuning our research paper and 
    slideshow presentation, ensuring both were well-organized and visually effective.

    After a quick lunch break in Room 116 (thanks to some leftover pizza from a previous event!), we had a valuable feedback session with our
    faculty. Their critiques provided clear guidance on areas for improvement, especially in how we structure and present our slides. This feedback 
    will definitely help us deliver a more polished and impactful presentation.

    I also dedicated time to networking on LinkedIn and applying for more internships—further strengthening my professional presence and 
    increasing my chances of landing meaningful opportunities.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today reinforced the importance of preparation, feedback, and continuous learning. Practicing my pitch reminded me that confidence comes
    with repetition and refinement. The feedback session was a humbling but essential reminder that even small changes can make a big difference 
    in how our work is perceived.

    Balancing presentation prep with career-building activities like LinkedIn networking also felt like a step forward in aligning my academic
    experience with my professional goals. Every small task—from fixing slides to sending out internship applications—felt like an investment in 
    my future.
