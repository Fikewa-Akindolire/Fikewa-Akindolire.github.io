what_i_learned: |
    Today we spent time exploring different algorithms to train our machine learning model using the SKLearn library. I tried out decision tree regression, gradient boosting, and support vector machines (SVM). It was cool to see how each one worked differently and to learn that the closer the R-squared value is to 1, the better the model is at making accurate predictions. After we tested the models, we went back and reviewed each line of code together to really understand what everything meant. It helped connect the dots for me, and I feel more confident reading and using these models now.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today was a slower-paced day, and honestly, I really appreciated that. It gave us a chance to relax a bit, dive into our work without rushing, and have some meaningful conversations. During breaks and even while we were coding, my teammates and I shared more about our personal stories. It reminded me how much you can learn from the people around you—not just about code or school, but about life. It made me feel even more connected to the team and excited for what’s ahead
