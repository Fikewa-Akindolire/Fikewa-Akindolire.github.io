        Today’s session was packed with valuable insight into how machine learning models are evaluated and improved. We began the day in the lecturehall with our secondary graduate mentor, Mr. Daniel, who led us through an engaging discussion on classification evaluation metrics and their importance in assessing model performance. We then transitioned into learning about regression machine learning metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² (coefficient of determination)—each offering a unique perspective on model accuracy.
    
    Mr. Daniel also introduced us to feature importance, helping us understand how different variables contribute to predicting PM2.5 levels. This gave me a better grasp on how to prioritize data when building models.
  
    Following that, we were given 30-minute interval data from a file called Padonia, which included four years’ worth of information. Using everything we’ve learned so far in the program, we processed, cleaned, trained, and tested the data. We even experimented with different feature combinations in hopes of maximizing our R² score.

        It was extremely hot today, and we were sweating during the first half of the session, which made it hard to concentrate until we relocated 
to a cooler space. 
  
reflection: |
        Working with the Padonia dataset felt like a culmination of everything we’ve been building toward these past few weeks. It was empowering to
put our knowledge into practice in such a hands-on way. Comparing results and performance metrics with my peers helped me realize how even 
small feature changes can have a big impact on model accuracy.

        The heat made it difficult to focus at times, but relocating to the business building allowed us to push through and be productive.
Despite the temperature challenges, I left today feeling more confident in my ability to evaluate and improve regression models. It’s
exciting to see my technical understanding of machine learning really start to click.
