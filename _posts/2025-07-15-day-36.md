    Today was filled with a unique blend of self-discovery, collaboration, and technical growth. We kicked off the morning with an impromptu
    meeting in the business building where the entire cohort gathered. The focus of our session was on understanding ourselves better—how we learn,
    how we think, and how we work with others.

    We took two assessments: the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and a Learning Style Inventory. These tools helped us uncover insights
    about our personality traits and how we absorb and process information. To make the experience more interactive, we participated in a mini 
    scavenger hunt where we had to find peers who matched certain criteria from our personality and learning style categories—our goal was to
    get four in a row on the game sheet. It was a fun and engaging way to build connections across the cohort.

    In the afternoon, we transitioned back into our research labs for a technical meeting with our faculty mentor. During this session, we
    aligned on our weekly goals and discussed the types of outcomes we expect from the graphs we're generating. One major task we were assigned
    is to interpolate the data into 30-minute intervals—but with a twist. We’re not allowed to use the existing 10-minute data, so it will require
    some creative problem-solving and coding strategies.

    We ended the day on a light note with a few rounds of Uno, a great way to unwind after a productive day.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    What stood out to me most today was the balance between personal development and technical challenge. The personality and learning style 
    activities were more than just fun icebreakers—they gave me a clearer understanding of how I function in group settings and how I can maximize
    my learning during this internship. It reminded me that success in research and in industry isn’t just about technical skills—it’s also about
    knowing how to communicate, adapt, and collaborate effectively with others.

    The technical meeting with our faculty mentor helped solidify the direction of our project this week, and I’m excited (and a little nervous)
    about the new challenge of interpolating the data. Being pushed outside of my comfort zone is where I’ve learned the most, and I know that diving 
    into this problem will sharpen my skills.

    All in all, today was a strong reminder that growth happens in both structured and unexpected moments—from surprise meetings to game-based 
    learning, and from technical hurdles to playing Uno with new friends.
