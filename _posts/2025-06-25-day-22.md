    Today, our day started in the business building, where we’re temporarily relocated. We jumped right back into building our slideshow presentations for our upcoming mid-summer internship showcase. I finalized the introduction speech I’ll be delivering to kick off the presentation — crafting a message that not only introduces my team and mentors but also draws the audience in with a compelling and relatable hook.

    From there, I moved back into the technical side of our project. I focused on combining two machine learning models in Python: Random Forest Regression and the GTW (Geographically and Temporally Weighted) Regression model. The goal is to merge the strengths of both — capturing both nonlinear relationships and spatial-temporal trends — to improve our predictions of PM2.5 levels.

    Later in the day, we took a short break and watched videos of the Haka dance, a traditional performance rooted in Hawaiian and New Zealand culture. It was a powerful reminder of how expression and community are deeply intertwined across the world.

    To close out the day, our faculty mentors joined us in the business building to review our slide decks. They provided insightful feedback to help us refine our presentations and polish our delivery.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today was a strong balance of technical growth and presentation readiness. Crafting the opening speech gave me a chance to step into a leadership role and set the tone for our group’s work. I wanted our introduction to not only explain what we’re doing but why it matters — especially to those who might not have a background in environmental science or machine learning.

    On the technical side, combining the Random Forest and GTW models was both a challenge and a breakthrough. It pushed me to think about how models can complement one another, and how merging different approaches can lead to more accurate, meaningful outcomes.

    And honestly, the Haka dance break was a surprising highlight — a cultural moment that reminded me of the importance of connection, passion, and purpose in all forms of work.

    As we prepare for our mid-summer presentations, I feel more grounded in our mission and more confident in my ability to contribute — both technically and as a communicator.
