what_i_learned: |
    Today began with a full cohort meeting where we continued with part two of the research paper writing workshop led by Dr. Pandey and the team from the MSU Writing Center. The session was highly informative, providing valuable insights into the structure and nuances of academic writing. Although it felt a bit long-winded at times, I appreciated the thorough explanations and examples they shared to help improve our research writing skills. After the workshop, I returned to the lab to focus on our team project, specifically working on building an LSTM model to predict PM2.5 concentrations. I used TensorFlow to program the model, but initially, the correlation between the actual and predicted values was quite poor. To improve the model’s performance, I tweaked the code and increased the number of training epochs, hoping to boost the R² score. Unfortunately, these adjustments didn’t lead to significant improvement. It became clear that the main challenge lies in the inconsistency and limited size of our time-series dataset, which hinders the model’s ability to accurately predict PM2.5 levels. While the models themselves are sound, the data constraints limit their effectiveness.

    I found it slighly dificult to concentrate during todays writing workshop because of tiredness and inactivity. 
  
reflection: |
    Reflecting on today’s experience, I realize how critical data quality and quantity are in machine learning projects. No matter how advanced or well-structured a model is, it cannot overcome fundamental issues with the underlying data. This has reinforced my understanding of the importance of thorough data collection and preprocessing before diving too deep into model training. Additionally, the research paper workshop reminded me of the value of strong communication skills in research. Being able to clearly and  effectively present findings is just as important as the analysis itself. Overall, today was a mix of progress and learning, both technically and academically, highlighting the ongoing challenges and rewards of working in data science and research.
