what_i_learned: |
    Today was centered around both refining our group work and diving into individual learning. We started the morning back in our original lab space in Calloway, where we focused on fine-tuning our slideshow presentations. With feedback from our mentors fresh in our minds, I made adjustments to enhance clarity, structure, and delivery.

    Afterward, we were encouraged to engage in solo learning, and I took the opportunity to explore neural networks in greater depth. I watched a series of videos covering foundational concepts and different types of networks, including:

    - CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) – great for image recognition and processing.

    - RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) – used in sequence prediction and time-series data.

    - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) – a special kind of RNN that’s good at remembering information over long sequences.

    This deep dive helped me better understand how these architectures process data differently and why they’re used in specific machine learning problems.

    It was really hot outside when I went to pick up my check from Tyler Hall. This made it difficult walking to and back. Also while showing documentation of my student status, I unfortunately forgot my bear card. Luckily I had an image of it and was able to show the lady who was attending to me. 
  
reflection: |
    Compared to the fast-paced and highly structured days earlier this week, today felt more relaxed and self-directed. The freedom to explore on my own helped me absorb the material at my own pace, especially something as complex as neural networks.

    Taking a walk to Tyler Hall with a group member to pick up our checks added a nice break to the day, making it feel more balanced. Even though it was a “chill” day, I still walked away with a deeper understanding of key machine learning concepts. Sometimes slowing down is necessary for everything to really click—and today was a reminder of that.
