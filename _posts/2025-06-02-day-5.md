what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first in-person cohort meeting, and it was both fun and informative. We started in the auditorium with a welcome presentation from the program coordinators and directors, who shared what to expect from the program and how we’ll be supported throughout the summer.

    We played an interactive game to learn about AI research, where we explored how independent and dependent variables help AI systems learn and improve through data. It was a great intro to the research process.

    Later, we broke into teams and took on the Marshmallow Challenge — building the tallest structure using spaghetti, tape, and a marshmallow. It showed how important teamwork, communication, and creativity are in problem-solving.

    In the lab, our graduate mentors introduced us to our research topic. I learned about aerosols, urban pollution, and how human activity like construction can displace and damage the environment. It helped me see the real-world impact of environmental science.

    We ended the day with lunch and bonding time. My group discovered we all shared African roots — Nigerian, Ghanaian, and Zimbabwean — and we connected through music, culture, and shared experiences. That cultural exchange made our team feel even more united.

    This helped me better understand how attention levels fluctuate, especially when switching between tasks. I also learned how to calculate moving averages to reduce noise in the signal while preserving response time.

  I had no blockers.

reflection: |
  Meeting my cohort in person today was such a great experience. It felt amazing to finally connect face-to-face and share real conversations and laughs. We learned how AI uses data and variables through a fun interactive game, and the Marshmallow Challenge showed how important teamwork really is. In the lab, we dove into topics like aerosols and urban pollution — which made the purpose of our research feel real.

    One of my favorite parts was bonding with my group over our shared African roots. That cultural connection made everything feel even more meaningful. I left today feeling excited, inspired, and ready for what’s next.
