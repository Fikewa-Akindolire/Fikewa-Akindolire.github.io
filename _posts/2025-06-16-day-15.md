    Today was a deep dive into the world of machine learning, both in theory and in practice. My group began with a discussion that helped us distinguish between different types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and recognition-based learning. These categories are essential for understanding how models learn from data and make predictions or classifications.

    We read articles that explained the SKLearn (Scikit-learn) library and its role in implementing machine learning techniques, especially within the context of climate science. SKLearn is a powerful Python library that makes it easier to apply various machine learning algorithms, from regression to classification, and it’s especially helpful when analyzing large datasets like those used in environmental research.

    Later in the day, we visited a rare large-scale LiDAR station—one of only six in the world—which gave us a firsthand look at the kind of physical infrastructure that supports the kind of data we’re working with. When we returned, we attended a lecture that broke down how to develop a machine learning algorithm, including how to build and train a model using SKLearn. We specifically learned how to call different functions from the SKLearn library to process data.

    Finally, we showcased the work we did last week, which included preprocessing CSV files, concatenating datasets, and creating regression graphs. This hands-on experience allowed us to put theory into practice and visualize trends within our data.

    Today really helped solidify my understanding of how machine learning connects with climate science and real-world data. Being able to discuss the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and recognition learning helped clarify how machine learning models “learn.” The SKLearn library is starting to feel more manageable, especially now that I’ve seen how its functions are used step by step.

    Visiting the LiDAR station made everything feel much more real. It was a reminder that all the data we’re working with doesn’t just appear—it’s collected through advanced technology that scientists and engineers have spent years building. That context made our later discussions and hands-on coding work more meaningful.

    Seeing our progress from last week through our regression graphs felt like a full-circle moment. It showed me that even when coding feels challenging, the results are rewarding and understandable when broken down. I’m excited to keep learning how to build smarter models and apply them to problems that matter.
