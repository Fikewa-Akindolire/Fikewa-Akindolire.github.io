what_i_learned: |
    Today was a slower-paced but productive day centered around deepening my understanding of machine learning, specifically in the area of deep learning algorithms. I spent a good portion of my time reading research articles on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models through Google Scholar. It was interesting to explore how ANNs are designed to mimic the human brain’s structure and how LSTMs handle sequential data, like time series or natural language, by retaining information over longer periods.

    Outside of the technical reading, I also took time to explore career opportunities in business management. I browsed through job postings, company profiles, and role descriptions to get a better sense of what industries are looking for and where my skills could fit.

    In between, I made more progress on my Product Management Product Roadmap certificate. It’s been helpful learning how to structure product goals, prioritize features, and align roadmaps with business strategies — skills that feel valuable whether I stay in tech, business management, or both.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Although today wasn’t as hands-on as some of my recent coding days, it felt good to slow down and focus on learning at my own pace. I’ve realized how important it is to have a balance between actively building and quietly absorbing new concepts.

    Diving into deep learning topics helped me appreciate how much there still is to learn in the AI/ML space, and it motivated me to think about how these technologies might be applied in areas like business strategy and product development.

    I also liked that I took time to explore career paths and skill development outside of just coding. It reminded me that professional growth is just as much about knowing your options and building transferable skills as it is about technical expertise.

    All in all, a calm, reflective, and enriching day.
