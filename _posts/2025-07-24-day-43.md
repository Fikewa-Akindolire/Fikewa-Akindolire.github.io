what_i_learned: |
    Today was all about creativity and teamwork. I kicked off the morning diving straight into editing our pitch video. I added sound effects, visual 
    clips, and mini videos to enhance the flow and keep it engaging. Because I already have experience editing promotional content for my hair 
    page, this part felt familiarâ€”but it was exciting to apply those same skills to an academic project with real impact.

    During lunch, Gracelyn and I worked on the voiceover. I took on more of a coaching role, helping her shape the pacing, pitch, and emotion in her 
    delivery so it would really resonate with viewers. Afterward, I reedited the video with the final audio, polished everything up, and we were
    finally ready to share it. Presenting it to our team and then to our graduate and faculty mentors was rewardingâ€”it felt like all the pieces came 
    together.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    What made today so memorable wasnâ€™t just finishing the videoâ€”it was how much joy and collaboration came with it. Everyone had a role, and we 
    celebrated the creative process along the way. After showcasing our final product, we even had a dance break with our graduate mentor, Dr. Li. 
    I had the chance to teach the Hamba Wena and Jerusalema dances to the group, which brought a fun energy to the day and reminded me that learning
    and joy can go hand in hand.

    Today was a reminder that soft skills like communication, creativity, and teamwork are just as important as the technical work we do. It was a 
    day full of laughter, leadership, and learningâ€”and that balance made it all the more impactful.
