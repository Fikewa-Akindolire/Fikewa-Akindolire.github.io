what_i_learned: |
    Today, I dove into the technical side of research writing by converting my Google Docs draft into Overleaf. This gave me hands-on experience with
    LaTeX — formatting section headers, inserting figures, graphs, and citations using our reference database. I learned how structured and meticulous
    academic formatting can be, especially when preparing a paper for formal review or publication.

    I also gained more insight into effective presentation design. I created slides for our upcoming final presentation, ensuring everything from 
    layout to transitions was clean, engaging, and aligned with our key message. Finally, I revised my opening pitch based on faculty feedback, 
    improving clarity, tone, and delivery.

    I had trouble understanding and finding the different lines of code for formating in Overleaf. It was a learning curve, but with the help
    of google I was able to get through it. 
  
reflection: |
    Today reminded me that presentation and preparation go hand in hand — whether it's for a research paper or a live pitch. Shifting from the writing 
    phase to the visual and verbal delivery stage required me to think critically about how to communicate our findings clearly and confidently.

    Practicing my lines and learning the flow of my slides helped me realize how much I’ve grown in public speaking and project ownership. It's not 
    just about knowing the content — it’s about being able to communicate it well under pressure. I'm proud of the progress I've made, and I’m 
    excited to bring it all together on Thursday.
