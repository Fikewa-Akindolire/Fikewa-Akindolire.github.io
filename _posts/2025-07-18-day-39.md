    Today was a fun and informative day that blended celebration with hands-on learning. We started by celebrating my teammate Gracelyn’s birthday, 
    and it felt great to surprise her with a cake—she really appreciated it, and it brought a lot of joy to the group. Afterward, we visited the 
    Meteorological Ground Station and the Atmospheric Mobile LiDAR Station. One of the highlights was flying a state-of-the-art drone valued between 
    $15,000 and $50,000. This drone collects real-time atmospheric data and can also capture both video and images, which was really fascinating to see 
    in action.

    We also learned about the various instruments used for measuring atmospheric conditions. This included equipment that detects the sun's residual 
    radiation and devices that measure rainfall. Each tool had a unique function and contributed to the larger mission of monitoring and understanding
    our atmosphere. To end the visit, we launched a high-altitude balloon—this one was much larger and more advanced than our previous launches,
    showing how our equipment and methods have progressed over time.

    Today reminded me how powerful experiential learning can be. It’s one thing to study atmospheric data collection in theory, but getting to 
    interact with the tools and technology firsthand made the science come alive. Flying the drone and seeing the data collection process up close 
    gave me a better appreciation for how much planning and precision goes into fieldwork.

    On a personal note, being able to bring a little joy to Gracelyn’s day made the morning feel even more meaningful. It was a great reminder that 
    science is about collaboration and community, not just data and results. Overall, today was a perfect mix of connection, curiosity, and hands-on
    experience.
