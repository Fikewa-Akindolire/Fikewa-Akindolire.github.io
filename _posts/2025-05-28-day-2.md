what_i_learned: |
  Today, we met with faculty mentors and grad student leaders to discuss our project, “Monitoring Urban Air Pollution from Satellite Data Using Machine Learning.” We talked about what the project involves and the prep work needed before next week.

  We also worked on our GitHub website, getting the homepage, blog, and index set up. In Python 101, we learned that Python is a simple coding language used to communicate with computers. We covered print() for displaying output, strings (text in quotes), concatenation (combining strings), and type() to check data types.

  We ended the day with a fun game of Headbands to cool down.

  I ran into some trouble setting up my blog page because I had multiple repositories, all with the wrong username. It caused some confusion at first, but once I corrected the usernames, everything started working smoothly.

reflection: |
  Today was very informative, and I learned a lot. I enjoyed getting acquainted with the faculty mentors and discussing our project on air pollution and machine learning. It helped me feel more connected and clear about what’s ahead. Setting up our GitHub site and learning Python basics was also exciting. Playing Kahoot made the learning fun and helped solidify what we covered. Ending the day with Headbands was a nice, relaxing touch.
