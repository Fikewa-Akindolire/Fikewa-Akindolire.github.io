    Today was a well-rounded day that mixed learning, feedback, and some much-needed fun.

    I started the morning by replying to two group video discussions from last week’s presentations. It was interesting to hear about their research topics and how other teams are approaching data challenges. Giving feedback helped me think critically about how we present our own work and where clarity really matters.

    After that, I dove into reviewing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) — a type of neural network architecture used for sequence data. I spent time understanding the history behind LSTM, why it was created to solve the limitations of traditional RNNs, and how it’s applied today, especially in tasks like time series forecasting and natural language processing. I also looked into how to implement LSTM models using Google Colab, which made it a lot easier to follow along with tutorials and experiment in real time.

    Later in the day, we had a quick meeting with our undergraduate mentors. They gave us guidance on writing our research paper and shared examples of what a strong paper should look like. It was helpful to see what’s expected in terms of structure and writing tone.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    One thing I’ve realized is how much learning happens outside of just watching lectures or coding — giving feedback, asking questions, and seeing peer examples all help fill in the gaps. The LSTM review reminded me that understanding the “why” behind the tech is just as important as knowing how to use it.

    Ending the day with a lively game of Uno was the perfect reset. It got super competitive and loud, but moments like that help build stronger connections with the people around me — and that’s something I really value in these research spaces.

    All in all, today was a mix of productivity, growth, and some much-needed fun**
