what_i_learned: |
    Today began with an Overleaf workshop for our entire research cohort. Since we’re in the midst of writing our research paper, this session came
    at the perfect time. We walked through the layout, tools, and features of Overleaf, which helped me feel much more confident navigating the
    platform. What once felt intimidating is now manageable.

    Afterward, we returned to our individual labs to begin drafting our sections of the research paper. I was assigned the methodologies section,
    which allowed me to consolidate everything we've implemented so far—from data preprocessing to model building—and describe it in a way that’s
    structured and replicable.

    I also started working on my final pitch for the summer symposium. With the script now complete, I’m feeling more excited than anxious 
    to present. It’s rewarding to see my growth captured in a few minutes of storytelling.

    To wrap up, I spent time applying to mentorship programs and job opportunities, while also enrolling in a new AWS certification
    course: Cloud Technical Essentials. I'm auditing it to better understand cloud computing and strengthen my technical foundation for future roles.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today reminded me how much structure and support can ease anxiety and spark motivation. Starting with the workshop set the tone for a productive
    day, and having clear deliverables—like writing my methodology section and preparing my pitch—gave me momentum.

    Diving into AWS and career applications at the end of the day helped me zoom out and reflect on the bigger picture: this internship is just 
    one step in my journey, but it's already equipping me with tools, confidence, and direction that I’ll carry long after it ends.
