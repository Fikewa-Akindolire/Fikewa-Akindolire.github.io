    Today was a day filled with exploration, discovery, and connection. All of the CEAMLS research groups gathered in the School of Business to 
    kick off the morning with a guided tour of Morgan State University (MSU). We visited the major buildings across campus and learned more about 
    the different schools and programs offered here. It was a great opportunity not only to see the university’s layout, but also to connect on a 
    deeper level with the other undergraduates in the program. There’s something really powerful about experiencing a space together and sharing 
    future goals.

    After the tour, we had lunch and returned to our respective research labs. That’s when the hands-on science began! We prepped for a high-altitude
    balloon release by filling a large balloon with helium and attaching a small device—placed inside a cup—that included a chip to collect 
    atmospheric data. We walked over to the Jenkins building for the launch, and as the balloon ascended, we were able to monitor its progress 
    live through the connected computer system.
    
    Watching the real-time data roll in was exciting. We observed variables like humidity, temperature, altitude, distance traveled, and ascent 
    speed (measured in meters and meters per second). Seeing the data visualized instantly made the science come alive. We also documented the
    experience with photos and videos, capturing both the launch and the live results.

    To end the day, we returned to our labs to continue reviewing literature and practicing our Python skills. Bit by bit, I’m starting to
    understand how everything we’re doing—research, programming, experimentation—fits into the larger picture of environmental science and 
    machine learning.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today reminded me how science is not only about understanding but also experiencing. The balloon release was the perfect example of theory 
    meeting practice. It was incredible to watch the data unfold in real time and realize that we were tracking something happening miles above us.

    I also felt a deeper sense of community after the MSU tour. Connecting with fellow undergraduates reminded me that we’re all on this journey 
    together—growing, asking questions, and building our skills one day at a time.

    Practicing Python again, even just a little, helped reinforce what I’m learning. Each small step builds toward something greater. 
    I’m beginning to see how powerful programming can be when paired with research and real-world tools. It’s motivating me to stay curious, 
    stay focused, and keep going—even when things feel new or challenging.
