    Today was a fun and insightful day filled with learning and hands-on activities. We started with Part 3 of our Python 101 series and continued 
    working on Replit, where we created a Tip Calculator and a Wage Calculator. We learned how to write code that asks users questions and calculates 
    results based on their input—seeing it all come together was really rewarding! We also played a round of Kahoot to test our knowledge, which
    made the learning environment fun and interactive.

    After Python, we shifted into exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence, diving into topics like generative AI models, machine learning, 
    deep learning, large language models (LLMs), tokenization, embeddings, and prompt engineering. One of the highlights of the day was an AI 
    detection game, where we looked at images and tried to guess whether they were human-made or AI-generated. This led to a discussion on how to detect
    AI content and the growing importance of AI watermarking to ensure transparency and authenticity.

    I had no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
    Today felt a bit less intense than previous sessions, which gave me more room to process and enjoy what we were learning. Even though it was
    more relaxed, the day was still jam-packed with valuable information. I especially enjoyed working on the Tip and Wage Calculators—it made me 
    feel more confident in my coding skills and showed me how practical Python can be. The AI segment was eye-opening and made me think more
    critically about the media we consume. Overall, today struck a great balance between learning, fun, and creativity.
