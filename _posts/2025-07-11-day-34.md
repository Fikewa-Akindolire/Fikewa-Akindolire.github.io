what_i_learned: |
    Today was a blend of presentation, progress, and practical application. We kicked things off with our weekly slide presentations, where each of us shared the accomplishments and challenges we faced over the past week. It was insightful to hear what others had been working on and reflect on how our efforts connect to the broader goals of the research team.

    Later, I resumed work on my Product Roadmap Certificate — a project I’ve been steadily working on and am excited to wrap up soon. It's given me a deeper understanding of how to align product goals with user needs and business outcomes, especially relevant to my aspirations in product management.

    One of the most hands-on parts of the day was a mini assignment: creating eight separate graphs for different locations across Nigeria, each comparing PM2.5 or SO2 levels to asthma incident rates. This exercise helped visualize how environmental pollutants might be impacting respiratory health across regions. Once completed, we shared our visualizations with our graduate mentors for review.

reflection: |
    Today felt rewarding in a calm and steady way. The weekly presentation served as a good checkpoint — not just to share what I’ve done, but to really see how all the small wins add up. Finishing off the PM2.5 and SO2 vs Asthma graphs made the data feel more alive, and showed how important it is to make environmental trends visible, especially when public health is on the line.

    The certificate work was a nice way to close out the day. It's reminded me that while technical work is essential, building frameworks to guide how products grow and serve users is just as crucial. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made, both technically and professionally, and I’m motivated to keep pushing forward — one graph, one module, and one milestone at a time.
